    <h3> Then welcome to NYC! In order to live a healthy lifestyle this city requires a six figure income- especially if you even dream of exercising in a boutique studio. This platform was created by a frustrated and overworked millenial who was bored of hitting the basic yet boring machines at Blink (the only gym membership under $50/month).</h3> 
<!--add spacing?-->
    <h3>This is your key to taking classes at boutique studios without having to shell out $35 for the chance to sweat out some stress. Working out shouldn't be a perk reserved for the rich and the famous! We are all entitled to endorphins so take advantage of this platform and let's build a community of happy and healthy people!</h3>
